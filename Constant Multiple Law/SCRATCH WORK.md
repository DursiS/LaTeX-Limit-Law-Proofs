Claim: lim x->a (a ⋅ f(x)) = a ⋅ L

Proof



We will directly prove that lim af(x) = a ⋅ L using the ε–δ definition.



Let us first re-call the ε–δ definition:

For every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 where if 0 < |x-a| < δ then |f(x)-L| < e.



Then in our case, given e > 0, there exists δ > 0 where if 0 < |x-a| < δ then |af(x) - aL| < e.



Now suppose 0 < |x-a| < δ, now let us check |af(x) - aL| < e such that:

|af(x) - aL| < e

|a||f(x) - L| < e

|f(x) - L| < e/|a|



Now let delta = e/|a|, such that:

|af(x) - aL| < e/|a|

|a||f(x) - L| < e/|a|

|f(x) - L| < e



Then, for every epsilon, there exists a delta where if 0 < |x-a| < δ then |f(x)-L| < e.

Hence, the lim x->a (a ⋅ f(x)) is indeed a ⋅ L. So we can conclude: 



lim x->a (a ⋅ f(x)) = a ⋅ L
