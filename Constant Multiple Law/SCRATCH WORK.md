Claim: lim x->a (a ⋅ f(x)) = a ⋅ L



We will directly prove that lim af(x) = a ⋅ L using the ε–δ definition.



Let us first re-call the ε–δ definition:

For every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 where if 0 < |x-a| < δ then |f(x)-L| < e.



Suppose 0 < |x-a| < δ, let us analyse the distance from the limit point:

= |af(x) - aL|

= |a||f(x) - L|

= |f(x) - L| 

< |a|\*delta <= e/|a|



Choose delta = e/|a|, such that:

|af(x) - aL| < e/|a|

|a||f(x) - L| < e/|a|

|f(x) - L| < e



Then, for every epsilon, there exists a delta where if 0 < |x-a| < δ then |f(x)-L| < e.

Hence, the lim x->a (a ⋅ f(x)) is indeed a ⋅ L. So we can conclude:



lim x->a (a ⋅ f(x)) = a ⋅ L
